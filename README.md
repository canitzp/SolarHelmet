## About

This mod adds a little item, the "Solar helmet module", which can be applied to any helmet, that uses the default implementation from Minecraft.

When crafting together with a helmet, the helmet gets a new tooltip text and while you're wearing it in your helmet slot, it produces energy.  
The energy is internally stored and automatically applied to any item in you inventory that can hold FE (Forge Energy).  
The helmet itself can't be used as battery and the only way to extract the energy is by putting a energy consuming one, eg.: a battery, in your inventory.  
The helmet has no transfer limit, so it can be discharged as fast as possible (the real transfer rate depends on the energy consumer).
